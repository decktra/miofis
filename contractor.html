						<h2>Message from our founder</h2>
						<p>From MiOfis,<br><br>
							please receive our most sincere gratitude for your time invested in taking a look at this
							page.<br><br>
							We know that taking a job from A to Z in a flowing, flawless manner is always the goal. We also know
							that you have worked with awesome sub crews, that when it comes to their work, you can’t even speak
							highly enough of them. However, when it comes to the admin side of their business, you almost wish
							you didn’t know them. We have learned firsthand, that language is probably the biggest factor.
							Right now, from your mostly Spanish speaking sub crew pool, you’re probably using the ones that have a
							spouse who is bilingual, or have been able to grow enough to have an admin assistant. How much would
							it help your business if you can expand your crew capacity with other Spanish speaking crews (specially
							in peak season)? MiOfis (Me-Office – my office in Spanglish) has created an all-Spanish online app that
							these Spanish speaking subs can completely understand. It is not only in their native language; it was
							made so that a 2-year-old can navigate through it intuitively with no problem. How this helps you is that
							this app translates estimates and invoices to English, and it allows these Spanish speaking subs to send
							any of those documents straight to your e-mail, from their phones. They might not know how to use a
							computer, but they all have phones.<br><br>
							These estimates and invoices provide the necessary information that most contractors are looking for.
							Sub’s information, your information as their client, job address, PO if required, scope of work, and
							pricing; allowing for multiple line items if needed. It is sent in a proper Estimate/Invoice format, and it is
							also sent in a PDF attachment which you can upload in to your bookkeeping software, or print as
							required.<br><br>
							If our current format does not work for you as their client, we can all work together to get the proper
							document you need in order to move your jobs in your system, help our clients (your subs) get paid in a
							timely manner so that we all win. We believe that a real business is providing true value or solving a real
							problem. We hope to not only be helping these subs with their small businesses, but helping your
							business as well by giving you access to awesome laborers who just need some good admin help to also
							help close the jobs in your system.<br><br>
							The guy in the video might be a millennial, but really has an old school heart. He still got to read, listen,
							and see Zig Ziglar; and his most popular quote is the heart beat of this entrepreneur. “You can get
							anything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.” With this at the
							core of MiOfis, we made this truly accessible for any of your subs. All of our plans come with unlimited
							documents (estimates or invoices), and can be sent to unlimited number of clients stored in the cloud. If
							they can pay up front, they simply save money; so, we offer a 6-month and a 12-month plan option. At
							$2k for a year of unlimited estimate/invoice translation support, with 4 free phone consultations where
							they can have us help them with any admin task such as reaching out to their insurance agents to make
							sure they are providing the right info on their COI, that doesn’t even cover a month salary for a full-time
							admin assistant. To top it off, everyone at MiOfis comes from a construction industry background and is
							fully bi-lingual. So, we understand you and we understand them, and we want clear communication
							between you both.<br><br>
							So, if you have a perfect candidate you’d like to work with, or next time you run across someone you’d
							like to try out but doesn’t have the proper admin support, send them over to MIOFIS.APP. We’re here to
							help.<br><br>
							
							If you’d like to be considered for a referral program, please provide your information below. The phone
							number you provide below will be the reference number you want to give the sub your referring over to
							enter in their sign-up page where it asks for a reference number. This way we can track the number of
							subs we’re both helping out, and we’ll find a nice way to say thank you for the referral (we’re still trying
							to figure out what that looks like, and so we have also provided an optional box where you can provide
							an idea if you’d like).<br><br>
							Thanks again for your attention. We wish everyone that has made it this far, even those who haven’t,
							blessings and success!<br><br>
							
							Hesron Gomez<br>
							Found of MiOfis</p>
